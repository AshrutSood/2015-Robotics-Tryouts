Ashrut Sood      Ever since I began computer programming class earlier this school year, I have gained more and more interest in coding and especially Java. I want to get a better understanding of the use of Java for robotics and just in general. For the past three months, I have been practicing my skills on Coding Bat and Eclipse and have enjoyed all of the work. One of the reasons I have fun coding is because I do it with friends. Sree, Quinn, Tannay, and I all enjoy competing and racing against each other to see who can complete a program the fastest. We have worked after school with Steve to get a basic understanding of coding on Eclipse and using Git to share our work with each other. Over time we have all enjoyed working on the pre-build season projects that we have had to do. These include wiring and programming the encoders and the Dancebot for the dance performance. Another thing that really interests me about Java is that you can never finish learning. You can never have enough knowledge because there are always new and interesting ideas to learn. I also feel like I am persistent and I don’t give up when I am unable to figure out how to program something. I try to think about something for a while and if I get a little frustrated, I take a break to relax and return to it when I am ready again. Another huge component of programming, I believe, is pattern matching. For the past few months almost every day, I have been doing the Daily Set Puzzle that trains you to recognize patterns. I have studied a lot for this programming tryout and I look forward to the upcoming robotics season and my “Kiddy Approved” team shirt!
